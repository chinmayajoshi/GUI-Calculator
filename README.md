# GUI-Calculator
#### Made with Android Studio (Java and XML)

The mentioned calculator app works by taking an input "string" from the user and it calculated the arithmetic problem keeping in mind 
the BODMAS rule of arithmetics. (Brackets are not yet added).
Scalling of the application on devices of various screen sizes is still something to be improved upon.
There are still a lot of logical errors present within the app so "dont be overambitious".

##### .apk file can be downloaded directly from the repo under the name "app-debug.apk"
